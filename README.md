Added pages for the menu bar, 

Strava Map Tables is a web app that uses the Strava API to pull data from activities to populate a map and table
-added pages for Menu: YTD (year to date) for cumulative data, graphs page, and an about/contact page in the menu but still have to draft pages.
-worked on styling for the home page still no sure I like the look, but...
+todo:
    add graphs, and about/contact pages.
    need to finish index page -> need to get the profile data onto the index page and compact the js pages.
        -had to change a couple variable names in the athlete.js to make the profile data function work.
